Configuration files I use and to make it easier and quicker using git for myself. 

If you just stumbled across my repo feel free to use any of these if you need a quick start or just starting out in customizing your config files for your bashrc or kitty conf. I don't mind

Bashrc needs fastfetch and starship installed or will result in errors!! Can also remove what you want or don't want.
